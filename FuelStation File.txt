# constructor(diesel,petrol,electric) − This constructor is taking the number of slots available for different spaces and initializes object of the FuelStation class.
# open_fuel_slot(fuelType) − This method checks whether there is a vehicle space of given fuelType for the vehicle .
# The three slots diesel,petrol,electric are represented by int values. The constraint is a fueltype can only give in a slot space if fuelType is matched. If there is no space available, return false, otherwise fuel the vehicle in that space and return true.
# If there are 2 slots for diesel, no slot for petrol and 1 slot for electric, then constructor call will be like fuelStation(2, 0, 1), and if we call open_fuel_slot like −(2,0,1).It gives true and false response.
